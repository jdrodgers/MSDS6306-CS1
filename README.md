# Beers and Breweries!

### Introduction
In the course of being adults many, if not all of us have discovered Beer and the positives and negatives associated with said beverage.
We have obtained data of all the beers and all the breweries in America and wanted to find out more regarding each beer's Alcohol by 
Volume (ABV) and International Bittering Units (IBU) as well as much much more.

### Prerequisites
You are going to want to make sure you have downloaded the datafiles and the libraries we used in the course of our research which I am leaving below.  Of course you will have to use the install.packages() function if you do not have the packages listed below already installed.
```
# Load Beers data
Beers <- read.csv("Beers.csv")
# Load Breweries data
Breweries <- read.csv("Breweries.csv")
```
```
#Libraries
library(data.table)
library(knitr)
libary(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
```

# The Results
The results we have are presented in an Rmarkdown file that when ran, outputs the answers to 6 questions we were given as well as 
the conclusion we have regarding our research into beers around the country.  We hope you enjoy.
